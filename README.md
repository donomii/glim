# glim
OpenGL IMage library - A collection of routines for common image/texture functions

glim is an OpenGL ES 2.0 utility library, providing routines to take screenshots (of your GL window), render to texture, upload textures, and render text to textures (utf-8).

It is designed to work with Golang's GoMobile library, but should require little or no changes to work with other GL libraries
